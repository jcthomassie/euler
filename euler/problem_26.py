Reciprocal cycles
=================
https://projecteuler.net/problem=26

A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the
unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:

    1/2	 = 0.5
    1/3	 = 0.(3)
    1/4	 = 0.25
    1/5	 = 0.2
    1/6	 = 0.1(6)
    1/7	 = 0.(142857)
    1/8	 = 0.125
    1/9	 = 0.(1)
    1/10 = 0.1

Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be
seen that 1/7 has a 6-digit recurring cycle.

Find the value of d < 1000 for which 1/d contains the longest recurring cycle in
its decimal fraction part.
