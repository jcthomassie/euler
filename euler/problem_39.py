Integer right triangles
=======================
https://projecteuler.net/problem=39

If p is the perimeter of a right angle triangle with integral length sides,
{a,b,c}, there are exactly three solutions for p = 120.

    {20,48,52}, {24,45,51}, {30,40,50}

For which value of p â‰¤ 1000, is the number of solutions maximised?
